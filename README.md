Around 6th August - This is my platformer game that I made for my Computer Science A-level NEA project. I want to add all the features I originally wanted and more, I want to add things like multiplayer and enemy AI.

27th August - I've succeeded in creating a much better system for creating maps, using tilesets from Tiled, which allows me to make maps with a wider range of images, looking much better and being much easier to make.
I've also created simple working multiplayer. I am happy with progress so far, but I feel that it's time to switch to a game engine such as godot, I've coded in pygame so far to gain a better understanding of the code, but from here I feel an engine is much more practical.
Multiplayer is not fully functional, but the sockets are working which is the main part of multiplayer I wanted to solve.
